# Wickert2025-OTTAR-data-examples

Example [OTTAR](https://github.com/MNiMORPH/OTTAR) model outputs from:
* The Minnesota River
* The Cannon River
* The Green River
* Diamond Fork

These folders include the best-fitting model results, simulated with the help of [DAKOTA](https://dakota.sandia.gov/), alongside configuration files to reproduce these best-fitting results and test parameter sensitivity.

The spreadsheet contains source data alongside computed mean and standard-deviation channel widths for the Minnesota River, the Cannon River, and Diamond Fork. Mean and standard deviation widths for the Green River are from Walker et al. (2020).
